            <p>FIFA 18 is the best FIFA game ever made. It’s that simple. I cannot believe the huge leap the series has seen
              in one year. This entry is streets ahead of FIFA 17, let alone any that came before that. The football on the
              pitch is more fluid, passing is improved, close control better, and we finally have upgrades to the game’s
              offline modes. Throw all that in with Ultimate Team’s continued brilliance, another engaging story in The Journey:
              Hunter Returns and the Frostbite engine’s beauty, I don’t think we could ask for much more.Buy FIFA 18 now
              from Amazon UK | Amazon.com EA Sports deserves huge credit for the journey it has undertaken with FIFA.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
              <p> Starting off at the launch of the current generation of consoles with the ill-fated Ignite Engine, each
              year it was clear what the team was trying to implement. At times, the baby steps fixed some areas, while breaking
              others, like when heading became so overpowered for big men, many matches became a David Moyes cross-fest.
              Thankfully, crosses were broken at the same time, too, meaning there was some bastardised form of perfect imbalance.Then it was the turn of defending, with a way more advanced system meaning you actually had to think when
              you didn’t have the ball. Unfortunately, because defence was overhauled in one year, attacking felt awful,
              as that had to be fixed the following year. But now, here we are, and all those pieces have finally come together
              to form a beautiful picture. It’s hard to not admire the end result when the gameplay is this good.
              One huge complaint year-on-year has been that you’ll be dispossessed, concede a goal or commit an inexplicable
            Players can unlock items which include new clothes and hairstyles for Hunter. While FIFA 17 locked Hunter to
            the English Premier League and Championship, in FIFA 18 players can now experience new locations, such as Brazil
            and the United States.The trailer released for this game mode also shows numerous widely-known football
            players making an appearance such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Antoine Griezmann, Dele Alli, Thomas Müller, Gyasi Zardes,
            Rio Ferdinand and Thierry Henry.<br><br> NBA player James Harden is also featured in the trailer. Alex Morgan and
            Megan Rapinoe also make a cameo. The story mode also has new playable characters, such as Danny Williams, who
            is Alex Hunter's best friend, and also featuring a character new to the series, Alex Hunter's half-sister, Kim
            Hunter. <br><br>FIFA 18 features the porn including all time best Johnney sins and third tier of Germany's Bundesliga,
            the 3. Liga. It also features the Iceland national football team[13], the Saudi Arabia national football
            team, both the men's and women's national New Zealand teams and has again the Turkish Super League after EA renewed
            its license with them.<br><br> EA Sportsubs into FIFA 18 where the player can make a sub when the ball goes out of
            play. Also now in Career Mode players can watch interactive transfer negotiations happen and can also see
            their new singings unveiled in cut scenes.
